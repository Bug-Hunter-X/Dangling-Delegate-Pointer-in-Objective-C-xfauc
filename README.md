# Dangling Delegate Pointer in Objective-C
This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C error involving dangling pointers in delegate patterns. The `bug.m` file showcases the faulty code, where a `MyViewController` fails to properly release its delegate reference before deallocation, potentially leading to crashes. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.m`, addresses this by explicitly setting the delegate to `nil` in the `dealloc` method, effectively breaking the circular reference and preventing the dangling pointer issue.  This simple fix is crucial for robust memory management in Objective-C applications.
