The solution involves explicitly setting the delegate to nil in the `dealloc` method of the view controller:

```objectivec
@implementation MyViewController
// ... other methods ...

- (void)dealloc {
    self.myObject.delegate = nil; // Crucial fix: Release delegate reference
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```
This ensures that the `MyObject` instance does not retain a reference to a deallocated `MyViewController`, thus preventing the dangling pointer and subsequent crashes.  Modern Objective-C development often uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), minimizing manual memory management.  However, understanding these lifecycle issues remains important for situations involving weak references and custom object interactions.
